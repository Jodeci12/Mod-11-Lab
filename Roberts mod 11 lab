#9.1 (CLASS AVERAGE: WRITING GRADES TO A PLAIN TEXT FILE) Figure 3.2 presented a class-average script in which you could enter any number of grades followed by a sentinel value, then calculate the class average. Another approach would be to read the grades from a file. In an IPython session, write code that enables you to store any number of grades into a grades.txt plain text file.
grades = []
while True:
    grade = input("Enter a grade (or type 'done' to finish): ")
    if grade.lower() == 'done':
        break
    grades.append(grade)

with open('grades.txt', 'w') as file:
    for grade in grades:
        file.write(grade + '\n')
#9.2 (CLASS AVERAGE: READING GRADES FROM A PLAIN TEXT FILE) In an IPython session, write code that reads the grades from the grades.txt file you created in the previous exercise. Display the individual grades and their total, count and average.
with open('grades.txt', 'r') as file:
    grades = [int(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()]

total = sum(grades)
count = len(grades)
average = total / count if count > 0 else 0

print("Individual Grades:", grades)
print("Total:", total)
print("Count:", count)
print("Average:", average)

#9.3 (CLASS AVERAGE: WRITING STUDENT RECORDS TO A CSV FILE) An instructor teaches a class in which each student takes three exams. The instructor would like to store this information in a file named grades.csv for later use. Write code that enables an instructor to enter each student’s first name and last name as strings and the student’s three exam grades as integers. Use the csv module to write each record into the grades.csv file. Each record should be a single line of text in the following CSV format:
import csv

with open('grades.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    while True:
        firstname = input("Enter student's first name (or type 'done' to finish): ")
        if firstname.lower() == 'done':
            break
        lastname = input("Enter student's last name: ")
        exam1 = int(input("Enter grade for exam 1: "))
        exam2 = int(input("Enter grade for exam 2: "))
        exam3 = int(input("Enter grade for exam 3: "))
        writer.writerow([firstname, lastname, exam1, exam2, exam3])
